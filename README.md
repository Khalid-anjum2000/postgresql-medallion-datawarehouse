# 🏗️ Data Warehouse and Analytics Project using PostgreSQL 🚀

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project**!  
This repository showcases a complete data warehousing pipeline built with **PostgreSQL**, following the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold). It covers data ingestion, transformation, and dimensional modeling to enable effective analytical reporting.

---

## 🌐 Project Architecture

The project follows a **three-layer architecture**:

- **🔹 Bronze Layer**: Raw data is loaded directly from CSV files into PostgreSQL tables without transformation.
- **⚙️ Silver Layer**: Data is cleaned, transformed, and enriched using SQL — including type casting, column additions, and normalization.
- **🌟 Gold Layer**: Final analytical models are created as **views**, including **dimension tables**, **fact tables**, and **business-friendly aggregations**.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Build a modular and scalable **PostgreSQL-based data warehouse**
- Ingest raw CSV files from CRM and ERP systems
- Perform data cleansing and transformation using SQL
- Model star schema using views for analytics
- Demonstrate business insights through dimensional queries

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+
- **Interface**: pgAdmin 4 or any PostgreSQL client
- **Data Source**: Local CSV files (ERP and CRM datasets)
